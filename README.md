# ABANDONED INDEFINITELY

## bb_compliments

A silly project to force myself into building anything. Basically it's a widget to spit out compliments and generally brighten someone's day.

### Goals

- Manage multiple users, default to the last one
- Run automatically each day
- Small widget notification with given compliment
- additional simple commands such as what's the weather and respond with the weather and a compliment
